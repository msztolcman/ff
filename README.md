ff
==

Easily search and process files.

If you need to search files by their contents, *or* search for their contents, please look at [ack](https://github.com/petdance/ack2) or [pss](https://github.com/eliben/pss). These are better suited for this kind of task.

If you like this tool, just [say thanks](https://saythanks.io/to/msztolcman).

Current stable version
----------------------

1.0.5

Why `ff` and not `find`?
------------------------

Just because I find that most of my searches was:

    find . -iname '*name*'

And it's easier to me to enter:

    ff name

Also, my `find` have sometimes problems with non ascii names:

    % find /tmp -name '*GÖS*'
    % 

And with `ff`:

    % ff '*GÖS*' /tmp
    /tmp/eee_GÖS_från_förstår_pas
    /tmp/eee_GÖS_från_pas_förstår_qq
    /tmp/pas_GÖS_från_förstår
    %

it just works! :)

Additionally, `ff` should work on any platform where [Python](http://python.org) is available, it means Linux, MacOS X, Windows (not tested here) etc.

Basic usage
-----------

    ff passwd

Search for all files and directories in current directory and below, which is match to pattern: `*passwd*`.

    ff -B passwd

Search for all files and directories in current directory and below, which is match to pattern: `*passwd`.

    ff -E passwd

Search for all files and directories in current directory and below, which is match to pattern: `passwd*`.

    ff -EB passwd

Advanced usage
--------------

    ff -p pa -s /tmp --shell-exec -x '[ -f "{path}" ] && mkdir -p /tmp{dirname}; cp -r "{path}" "/tmp{path}"'

Find all files and directories in /tmp that match expression: `*pa*`, and copy them (with original directories hierarchy!) to /tmp.

So powerful!

Magic pattern
-------------

It's form of pattern known good for Perl or AWK lovers :)

If patterns is in general form:

    mode/pattern/modifier

(decribed more in full usage below), then it is parsed and used in a little other manner.

Instead of arguments `--regexp` or `--fuzzy`, you can pass it in `mode` part of pattern.
Next there is delimiter, which usually is `/` (backslash), but there can be more characters,
described in Usage section.

After that is a pattern, next delimiter again, and then modifiers (again, modifiers are described in Usage section).

Some examples:

Search for all files and directories in current directory and below, which is match to pattern: `passwd`.

    ff f/pwd/

Search for all files and directories in current directory and below, which name contains letters 'p', 'w', 'd', with any other characters between them.

    ff g/^(chk)?passwd/

Search for all files and directories in current directory and below, which name starts from 'chkpasswd' or 'passwd'.

Configuration file
------------------

`ff` recognizes 2 configuration files: user-wide and project-wide. Both can specify the same things and have identical syntax (ini files). User-wide one is located in `$HOME/.ff.rc`, and project-wide is located in current directory (ie. projects root).
Example file is located at [github](https://github.com/msztolcman/ff/blob/master/ff.rc).

Plugins
-------

Plugins are the way to easily extend capabilities of `ff`. Currently there is only support for plugins allowing to extend tests made on files list. In future, there is plan to add support for plugins allowing to make some actions on found files (currently is _built-in plugin_: `--shell`), for example modifying, copying or anything else).

`ff` search for plugins in user's home directory, but there is posibility to tell him about the other..
By default, `ff` search for plugins in:

* `~/.ff/plugins`

And using switch `--plugins-path` you can tell `ff` about other plugins location.

You can also pass argument to plugins. For example, in `size` plugin (bundled with `ff`), You must to tell the plugin what size of file You expect:

    `ff pas --test size:=5k`

Above example will find every file with _pas_ part in its name, and its size is *exactly* 5 [kibibytes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix#IEC_standard_prefixes). More about `size` plugin in [projects wiki](https://github.com/msztolcman/ff/wiki/).

Writing plugins
---------------

Plugins are written in [Python](http://python.org), and are simple Python modules with at least `plugin_action` callable specified. Plugins are imported, and `plugin_action` must return `True` or `False` to tell `ff` that given found object meets expectations, and should be returned.

`ff` recognize and use only 3 objects in plugin:

* `plugin_action` - (REQUIRED) [callable] must return `True` od `False`. Must recognize 3 arguments:
    * `name` - name of plugin
    * `argument` - argument passed by user
    * `path` - absolute path to tested object
* `PLUGIN_DESCR` - (OPTIONAL) [string or callable] short descr of plugin, printed when `ff` is called with switch `--help-test-plugins`
* `PLUGIN_HELP` - (OPTIONAL) [string or callable] full help for plugin, printed when `ff` is called with switch `--help-test-plugins TEST_NAME`

Plugin file also must have special name, and be placed in directory recognized by `ff` (see: [plugins][plugins]).
Name of file is built with three parts, connected with underscore:
* `ffplugin` - fixed prefix
* `test` - type of plugin (currently only `test` plugins are recognized)
* `NAME` - name of plugin

And as Python module, must and with `.py` extension :)

Plugin must validate input data (`argument`), and raise `FFPluginError` exception with approbiate message on any error. Plugin shouldn't raise any other exceptions.
There is one caveat with this: `FFPluginError` exception is declared *inside* `ff`! When given plugin is imported, it is _monkeypatched_ and `FFPluginError` exception is injected into it.

There is an example plugin, which allow us to search for files in specified size. Is in [project repository](https://github.com/msztolcman/ff/tree/master/ff_plugins) in directory plugins. You can use it as a base for your own plugins :)

Installation
------------

1. Using PIP

`ff` should work on any platform where [Python](http://python.org)
is available, it means Linux, Windows, MacOS X etc. 

Simplest way is to use Python's built-in package system:

    pip install ff-find

2. Using sources

Download sources from [Github](https://github.com/msztolcman/ff/archive/1.0.5.zip):

    wget -O 1.0.5.zip https://github.com/msztolcman/ff/archive/1.0.5.zip
    
or

    curl -o 1.0.5.zip https://github.com/msztolcman/ff/archive/1.0.5.zip

Unpack:

    unzip 1.0.5.zip

And install

    cd ff-1.0.5
    python setup.py install

Voila!

      --plugins-path PLUGINS_PATH
                            additional path where to search plugins (see

      --show-plugins-paths  Show recognized plugins paths and exit
    
    Pattern, provided as positional argument (not with --pattern) can be provided
    in special form (called: magic pattern). It allows to more "nerdish"
    (or "perlish" :) ) way to control `ff` behavior.
    
    The general pattern for magic pattern is:
    
        mode/pattern/modifier
    
    where:
        mode - is one of 'p' (--pattern), 'g' - (--regexp) or 'f' (--fuzzy)
        / - is delimiter:
            * one of: '/', '!', '@', '#', '%', '|', and then start and end
                delimiter must be the same
            * one of: '{', '[', '(', '<', and the end delimiter must be the
                closing one (ex. '}' if start is '{')
        pattern - any pattern, processed in a way specified with 'mode'
        modifier - one of: 'i' (--ignore-case), 'm' (--regex-multiline),
            's' (--regex-dotall), 'v' (not used currently), 'r' (--invert-match)
    
    There is also ability to extend capabilities of `ff` by plugins. Plugins are
    run with switch --test and then plugin name with optional plugin argument:
    
        --test plugin_name:plugin_arg
    
    There can be used more then one plugin at once.
